# Customer Churn Analysis Project<br>
## Project Overview:
- This project investigates customer churn patterns using real-world data, focusing on understanding why customers leave and identifying factors that influence retention. The analysis primarily explores payment methods, contract types, customer tenure, service type, and demographic attributes to provide actionable insights for improving customer loyalty.
- The goal of this project is to help businesses reduce churn by identifying high-risk customer segments and recommending targeted retention strategies.

## Objective:
- Analyze factors contributing to customer churn.
- Identify high-risk groups based on contract type, payment method, tenure, and demographics.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention.

## Key Insights:
1. Contract Type
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate at 42%.
- One-year contracts: 11% churn rate
- Two-year contracts: 3% churn rate
- Insight: Longer-term contracts significantly improve customer retention.

2. Payment Methods:
- Customers paying via electronic checks have a churn rate of 45%, significantly higher than other methods.
- Credit cards, bank transfers, and mailed checks have churn rates averaging 15–18%.
- Insight: Convenience and trust issues with electronic checks may lead to higher churn. Encouraging stable payment methods could help reduce churn.

3. Customer Tenure:
- Customers with less than 1 year of tenure: 50% churn
- 1–3 years: 35% churn
- More than 3 years: 15% churn
- Insight: Early engagement is critical; retention programs should focus on the first year.

4. Internet Service Type:
- Fiber Optic users: 30% churn
- DSL users: 20% churn
- Insight: Service quality, competition, or customer satisfaction may influence churn. Understanding these factors can improve retention.

5. Senior Citizens:
- Customers aged 65+ have a churn rate of 41%, compared to 26% for non-senior citizens.
- Insight: Targeted retention programs for senior customers can reduce churn in this segment.

## Visualizations:
- Bar charts highlight churn disparities across contract types and payment methods.
- Line graphs show churn trends over customer tenure, revealing declining churn with longer tenure.
- Percentage-based insights make it easier to identify high-risk segments at a glance.

## Recommendations:
- Promote Long-Term Contracts: Offer incentives to encourage yearly or multi-year subscriptions.
- Address Payment Concerns: Encourage customers to switch from electronic checks to more secure methods.
- Early Engagement Programs: Focus on onboarding and personalized experiences for customers in their first year.
- Senior Citizen Retention Programs: Implement special offers or dedicated support to retain senior customers.
- Service Quality Improvement: Analyze and improve Fiber Optic service quality to reduce churn.
